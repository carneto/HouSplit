# RePepeca

RePepeca is a bill management system based in PHP and MySQL for people dividing houses and bills, especially university students. It is meant to be used by "Rep√∫blicas" - often shorted down to "Rep(s)" - which are houses divided by university students in Brazil, usually in a large number of people.

### Installation

To install RePepeca, you first need to run the SQL query on "sql/" folder and then copy the files in "src/" to your server, editing the "config.php" file to fit your needs.
